# TV App
This is a simple TV show search app that allows users to enter a keyword and search for TV shows by name. The app displays TV show posters in the search result container.

# Building the project
To build the project using webpack, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm on your machine if you haven't already done so.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```
4. Run the following command to build the project:
```
npm run build
```
This will compile the JavaScript and CSS files using webpack and output the bundled files in the 'dist' directory.
